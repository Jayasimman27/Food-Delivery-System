# Food Delivery Application

## Overview

The Food Delivery Application is a terminal-based project developed in C that allows users to order food from various restaurants. This application leverages text and CSV files to manage restaurant,customer data, menu items, and user orders, providing a straightforward and user-friendly interface.

## Compilation of the Program

To Run the program in the Terminal we should compile by executing gcc master.c login_user.c selection.c dijkstra.c restaurant_login.c cart.c bill.c payment.c mood1.c review.c dij4.c and run the file using ./.myprogram or myprogram.exe

All the Above Files are linked with headers.h


## Features

**Approach**

**1.Registration and login**

Registration includes the registration of the user into the Food Delivering Application with User name and Proper Password.

Login module includes verified and registered user name and password to Login the Food Delivering Application.

**2.Selection based on different categories**

- **Shortest Path**

It is based on one of the shortest path Algorithm (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) it uses nodes and edges to find the distance between the places and the restaurant

- **Based upon the search of food**

It works when the user want’s to select the Food what he wants to eat instead of selecting a restaurant first

- **Recommendation of Food**

It Recommends the food for the user (i.e. if the user selects a main dish it recommends a side dish or an additional dish for this based on the previous data what people have bought along with the main dish)
